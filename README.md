# CompBuilder-CS-IB-IA
Completed Project for Computer Science IB HL IA (Grade 6)

This is an attempt to create a desktop application for Computer Science IB IA. The application is programmed with Java, JavaFX, and MySQL. The app provides help to people who are interested in building computers by displaying computer parts' (e.g. RAM, CPU, PS, Motherboard, etc.) price and specifications. It hopes to simplify user's research experience when trying to build a computer. 

The application contains 7 databases, each representing a computer component. Each database contains data on individual component such as price, capacity, form factor, and more. This database is integrated into JavaFX's GUI to display the data from the databases and Java is used to direct data to-and-from different classes. Lastly, the application contains user database which stores users' credentials to validate if a person is an existing member of the application.
